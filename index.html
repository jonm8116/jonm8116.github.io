        Hi my name is Jon and I'm currently an undergraduate
        student at Stony Brook University. I'm in my fourth
        (and 1/2) year in my college career. I'm majoring in
        computer science with a minor in creative writing. 
        I enjoy working on projects in multiple areas.
        Some of those areas include microservices, machine
        learning, bioinformatics, scripting, scientific
        computing, and fantasy writing.

            The landing page for this website (the page
            you're on right now) is what you would call a
            now page. I use it to post updates about what
            I'm currently up to. <br/>
            The design of this page was largely inspired by
            <a href="https://katmh.com">Katherine Huang's
            webpage</a> and <a
            href="https://sarahlim.com">Sarah Lim's
            Webpage</a>
            <br/>
            The concept of a now page originated from <a
            href="https://sivers.org/nowff"> Derek
            Sivers webpage.</a>
