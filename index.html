        Hi my name is Jon and I'm a graduate from Stony Brook University. I majored in
        computer science with a minor in creative writing. I also took an assortment of
        classes in biology and psychology (I was on a premed track).
        I'm passionate about science, tech for social good and loving your neighbor.

            This the now page for my website.<br/>
            The design of this page (and other parts of my site) was 
            largely inspired by
            <a href="https://katmh.com">Katherine Huang's
            webpage</a> and <a
            href="https://sarahlim.com">Sarah Lim's
            Webpage.</a>
            <br/>
            The concept of a now page originated from <a
            href="https://sivers.org/nowff"> Derek
            Sivers.</a>
