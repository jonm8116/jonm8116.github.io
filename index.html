Hi &#128075; my name is Jon
<br/>
<br/>
I'm a software engineer who's still trying to figure out who he wants to be when
he grows up. I currently work in the embedded / IOT space <a class="links"
href="https://resideo.com">@Resideo</a>. So my day to day
usually translates to writing C/C++ and/or stripping lots of wire. Previously I
did more web dev centered work (i.e. Java and Angular) <a class="links"
href="https://www.lbisoftware.com/">@LBi</a>. 

<br/>
<br/>

My tech interests span embedded systems, web development, linux, hardware
development, open source, cybersecurity (and eventually rust when I get
around to learning it :P). 

<br/>
<br/>

Outside of tech I like being active. This could mean either learning how to
lift weights, hugging rocks on a wall or playing volleyball.
When I'm not doing those things I'm either taking too many pictures, watching
anime, or trying new food spots with friends.
