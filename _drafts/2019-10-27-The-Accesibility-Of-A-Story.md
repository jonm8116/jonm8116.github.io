This idea was something I recently got to discuss in a forms
of fiction class I'm taking for my minor. Accessibility was
something I've thought about for projects that typically
involved me typing code behind a computer. I had never
really considered how accessible stories were to there
audience. What determines a story's accessibility? 
<br/><br/>
That lecture we discussed a book that we had been reading in
class. The story within this book sometimes felt
incomprehensible. I didn't know before reading but found out
during lecture, you needed to have some background
in Greek Mythology to better understand the story.
