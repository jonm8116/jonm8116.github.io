First Post on this blog! I'm looking forward to adding more blog
entries soon. I'm not sure how I'm exactly going to write them.
If I'll just do them in vim or notepad. Or create a separate
system to write my posts in before they get submitted to the
site. Maybe I'll use good ol microsoft word.

But yea some future blog posts I wanted to consider were:
1. Post recapping Urbana 18'
2. Post on whether Yugioh could be Turing complete (Need to read
more on turing machines)
3. Post walking through code of YouTube trending project, and
process behind data gathering
4. Some creative writing works
5. Other random musings, be it philosophical or otherwise
6. Post on IV?
7. Post recapping years of college?
8. Post about future musings?
9. Post about certain courses?
10. Post on some other nerdy things or about being a TA
