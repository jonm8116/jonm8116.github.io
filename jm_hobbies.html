<h1>Sports</h1>
I'm a big fan of soccer and I enjoy both watching and playing the sport. 
Currently my favorite team in the Premier Leagues right now is Chelsea.
I also play in a local soccer league known as NYMSC. Other than soccer I
also enjoy playing tennis for the school team as well as outside. 
<h1>Poetry</h1>
I also like to do a little poetry here and there so I have two of my previous
works below.
<h1>Intellectual Pursuits</h1>
I enjoy learning new things ranging from areas of biology, philosophy, chemistry, computer science, 
and engineering. This is part of my reason for joining Web Design.
<h1><a href="jm_Travel.html">Travel</a></h1>
I also love to visit new places and here you could see some of the pictures I've taken
during my travels.

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Courage</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">
Darkness grows, it enters through the door<br/>
It surrounds me, seeping its way through the cracks on the floor<br/>
The abscence of light, it scares me, it terrifies<br/>
But it can do more because within me it creates a divide<br/><br/>

It influences me, it restrains me<br/>
It takes my brain and all it does is drain me<br/>
Of my hope and leaves me paralyzed<br/>
I am stuck in the void, I'm petrified<br/><br/>

This darkness, it's too much for me to bear<br/>
I cannot do anything so long as it stares<br/>
Hope enters<br/><br/>

I can move, I can see<br/>
A signal of light that is the source of my glee<br/>
Shows me a way out, a route of escape<br/>
But where will it bring me, where will it take?<br/>
Should I follow, should I stay?<br/><br/>

The light beckons<br/>
I give chase as the darkness pursues<br/>
It will attack me within seconds<br/>
But I turn around, I see it had withdrew<br/>
The light, my courage had pulled me through<br/><br/>

Finally free<br/>
I am no longer held by balls and chains<br/>
I can do anything that I please<br/><br/>

So I must not let fear take a hold of me<br/>
Because it can change who I am to be<br/>
Rather let courage to help me<br/>
Become the man I want to be<br/>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Escape</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">
Walking swiftly through the woods, Eyeing the Beast which haunted his nightmares,<br/>
Trying to bring him, within its grasp,<br/>
He fled.<br/><br/>

Moving quickly to escape its clutches. Until he found a bridge<br/>
His symbol of hope<br/>
He walked across<br/>
One foot in front of the other<br/>
He approached the other side<br/>
His source of salvation<br/><br/>

Only to face his demise<br/>
For all he could see<br/>
Was the Beast<br/>
Staring at him through its cold desolate eyes<br/>
