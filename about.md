        Hi, my name is Jon, and I'm a computer scientist,
        software engineer, athlete, writer, and college student. I
        currently am a research assistant in
        my school's computer science department. Outside of
        school, I am a developer for Elixir Labs a nonprofit that 
        creates software for other nonprofits. Previously, I 
        was a software engineering intern at LBi Software 
        and a teaching assistant for my school's introduction 
        to software development course.
   <p></p>
        I really enjoy Python, Machine Learning, Scientific
        Computing, Computational Biology, Rock Climbing,
        Fantasy Writing, Physics, Logic Puzzles, Math
        Simulations, Soccer, Basketball, and Volleyball.
   <p></p>
        Below I have my projects and future endeavors goals
        listed.

   Personal Website</a>

   <br/>

   This personal website I made using jekyll and an already
   developed theme called Gravity. I added some additional
   custom css to the make the design suit more of my tastes.
   This website will mainly be used to host updates on my
   upcoming endeavors and my blog where I'll write posts on
   tutorials, thoughts and creative writing.
   For the design of my website I took inspiration from Kat
   Huang and Sarah Lim. You should check out their pages as
   well!

   <a href="https://github.com/artvegas/overdrive_frontend">
   Overdrive Comics</a>
   <br/>

   <br/>

   This was the fullstack application I completed with a
   team for my school's capstone computer science course,
   software engineering. I worked in a team of four as the
   lead programmer and worked mostly on developing the
   angular architecture of the application. I also helped to
   make a few REST endpoints for our backend. At the end of
   the course we created a fullstack application written in
   Angular and Java Spring that acted as a social media site
   for web comics. Users could upload and create their own
   comics on the site. The site was hosted on AWS for the
   duration of the class.

   href="https://github.com/jonm8116/YouTube-Trending-Project">
   YouTube Trending Videos Classifier</a>
   
   <br/>
   <div class="proj-desc">
   <em style="font-size: 10pt;">Desc:</em>
   <br/>

   Using google's tensorflow library I worked with friends
   to train a deep feedforward neural network to recognize
   whether a particular YouTube video was trending or not
   when the video id was passed to the application. We first
   had built our dataset by scraping for both trending and
   non-trending videos on YouTube and using one existing
   trending videos dataset on kaggle. After we had scraped
   for all these video id's we pulled the data video using
   Google's video api. This was compiled into our final
   dataset of about 15k entries. Our neural network was able
   to recognize trending videos with about 90% training
   accuracy and 75% testing accuracy.

   <br/>
   This was a simple programming language I made for my
   school's programming languages course. Given the
   requirements for the class I developed the parse tree for
   the language and created the language using a python
   implementation of lex and yacc, <a href="https://www.dabeaz.com/ply/">ply</a>. 
   The language was able to create variables, if statements and perform loops.
