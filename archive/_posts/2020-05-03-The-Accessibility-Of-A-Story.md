I meant to post this blog post during my fall semester but I just didn't get
around to finishing it then. This idea was something I was introduced to during 
a creative writing class I took in college. What makes a story accessible?
First of all how would you define accessibility in regards to a story? 
I'd say it's the capability for a reader to dive into a story with as little
something I've thought about for projects that typically
involved me typing code behind a computer. I had never
really considered how accessible stories were to there
audience. What determines a story's accessibility?

That lecture we discussed a book that we had been reading in
class. The story within this book sometimes felt
incomprehensible. I didn't know before reading but found out
during lecture, you needed to have some background
in Greek Mythology to better understand the story.
