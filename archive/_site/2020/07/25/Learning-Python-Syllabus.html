    <p>So recently I’ve gotten many questions from friends and other people on how to learn to code.
Below is an email I sent to a friend that asked me about some tips on learning Python for research when he’s in medical school. Hopefully it can help someone else too.</p>

<p>If you want to really just get started trying to learn the language without downloading anything you could also use this website https://repl.it/languages/python3.</p>

<p>However I <em>HIGHLY</em> recommend downloading necessary software before trying to learn because it will be much more helpful.</p>

<p>Like I said before I believe the best way to learn programming is by writing code for some programming projects. Start with very small projects first then slowly increase their complexity. I think also working on projects that seem cool or fun is also helpful during this (there’s less friction for you to work on them). To provide a sample roadmap of what some of those projects may look like this one</p>

<p>Week 1: Data types, variables, if statements
Possible projects:</p>
<ul>
  <li>make a simple calculator. The program asks the user for two inputs and an operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide, exponentiate, etc) and you print out the result to the screen.</li>
  <li>write a basic text adventure game.</li>
</ul>

<p>Week 2: Loops, Functions, Strings
Possible projects:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Write a program called fizzbuzz. This is a program that will take in a number (n) as input to the program. It will go through all the numbers up to n and if the number is divisible by 3 print out fizz, if divisible by 5 print out buzz, if divisible by both print out fizz buzz or otherwise just print out the number and each number should be on a separate line.</li>
  <li>make a slightly more complex text adventure game</li>
</ul>

<p>Week 3: Importing libraries, file I/O, Lists/Arrays</p>
<ul>
  <li>now you can start to do a little more complex things
Possible projects:</li>
  <li>Write a program that will count how many files are in a folder/directory and print out the result</li>
  <li>read through a text file and print out every third line, write every second line to a different file.</li>
  <li>look up a library online that you could use to automate a task on your computer.</li>
</ul>

<p>Week 4: Classes and Objects
Possible projects:</p>
<ul>
  <li>you could continue to work on a text adventure game (I don’t know why I keep suggesting it but I think it’s a good learning tool and they can be fun)</li>
  <li>Make a simple email inventory system and model them through classes (things like how would you represent an email account as a class and how would you represent a message as a class)</li>
</ul>

<p>Week 5: HTTP requests and API things
Possible projects:</p>
<ul>
  <li>use the pokemon api to print out stats on some group of pokemon</li>
  <li>look up an api you find interesting and use it for some project. There are a bunch of really random and cool API’s out there so just gotta google around for them to find one you think is cool</li>
</ul>

<p>Now the schedule I proposed is just a sample one and may not be at the pace you’d prefer. So pick a schedule you think would work best for you and work around that. I do think though a good setup is to review a few concepts throughout the week and review that knowledge through a project of your own design. So aim to review concepts and do around 1-2 projects a week, these projects can vary in scope too!</p>

<p>You’re probably going to need to google around a bunch to figure out stuff which is good and necessary. Stackoverflow is your friend too. One thing I’d recommend is that when you find some code online that can help, don’t copy and paste, make sure to copy the code over by typing it out. It’s a small nitpick but I think it gives you more of a chance to think about the code you’re writing. So definitely google around when you need to find something out but make sure to understand the code that you use.</p>

<p>Here are some links to some libraries, software, and resources you may find helpful or interesting.</p>

<p>Library for computational biology programs         –&gt;                                         https://biopython.org/ <br />
Bioinformatics problem sets                                 –&gt;                                         http://rosalind.info/ <br />
Library for making HTTP requests                       –&gt;                                         https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/ <br />
Library for making web applications                     –&gt;                                         http://flask.pocoo.org/ <br />
Library for numerical / scientific computing          –&gt;                                         https://wiki.python.org/moin/numpy <br />
Library for developing some games                     –&gt;                                         http://www.pygame.org/ <br />
Pokemon API because why not bro                     –&gt;                                         https://pokeapi.co/ <br />
A text editor used in scientific computing             –&gt;                                         https://jupyter.org/ <br /></p>

<ul>
  <li>one note: Jupyter notebook is pretty nice but I would definitely recommend only downloading it after you’ve had some experience with python. Just get used to writing python in atom and running it through the terminal (like cmd or git bash for now).</li>
</ul>

<p>So that’s most of the things and you can always ask me questions at any time so just let me know if you have questions on something.</p>

<p>Also download pip                                                 –&gt;                                       https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/ <br /></p>

<p>It will be pretty helpful when you start using other libraries.</p>

<p>Anyway let me know if you have any questions.))))))</p>
