So we're more than halfway through December and Advent of Code is well underway. For those are unfamiliar of what Advent of code is you can check out the site <a href="https://adventofcode.com">here</a>. I have started to give a crack at some of the problems. Unfortunately I haven't made as much progress on them as I'd like (I've only gotten around to the first two problems) but I'm planning to catch up on them. Just things have been a little crazy with finishing up this semester and sending out applications. So soon I'll hopefully be able to catch up with everyone else who's participating in AOC this year. 
<br/><br/>
However I wanted to encourage everyone who has currently been working through advent of code and let y'all know about some other advent themed software content I found on the internet. 

<h2><a href="https://bekk.christmas/">Bekk Christmas</a></h2>
This website is a bit less interactive learning but still just as cool. The creator wanted to write an article each day leading up to Christmas in varying computer science topics. The author has wrote about topics ranging from security and functional programming to machine learning and open source. Definitely cool site you should check out if you want to learn something new. 
<br/><br/>
Also quick side note, I've been wanting to get a deeper understanding of functional programming for a while now. Particularly in Haskell and OCaml. Maybe I'll get my feet wet with some of the content on the site. 
<br/><br/>
<h2><a href="https://chrispenner.ca/posts/advent-of-optics-01">Advent of Optics</a></h2>
The author behind this site provides a few Advent of Code like challenges related to optics. He uses Haskell in his implementations but I'm sure you could convert some of the solutions into another language if you wanted to. It's another nice set of puzzles that could also let you learn about a new field. Worth checking out.
<br/><br/>
I hope y'all are having a good Advent season and for those who wanted to get into the season of Advent I leave you with this article.

See y'all in the next post!
