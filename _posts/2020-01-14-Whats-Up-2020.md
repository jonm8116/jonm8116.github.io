<p>
I'm a little late but we did it! We reached the new year. I wanted to have a blog post to start off the new year and recap some things from 2019 I'm grateful for. So this blog post will also be a way for me to publicly post my new years resolution for accountability. So below are some things I'm thankful for in 2019.
