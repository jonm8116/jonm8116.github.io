        <title>Dear Impact Labs Fellowship</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Dear Impact Labs Fellowship,
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I wanted to write this letter to talk about something I
didn’t get to talk about in my application (mainly because I
was afraid the story would be a bit too long for the form).
I wanted to write about the time I went with my university’s
InterVarsity fellowship for an event we called Feed500.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For this event we wanted to sit down and have lunch with people
looking for a meal in Manhattan. We took an 8am LIRR train from
Stony Brook to Penn station with about 25 lunches packed
with Bagels, Granola bars, an apple and bottles of Sunny D
and water. Once we reached the station we broke off into
groups of 3 to see who we could hand out lunches to. My
group left the station and sat down with two to three people
before we came to the outskirts of Central Park. Once we
arrived at that intersection we sat down with another man
who was seated right outside of the building next to us.
Let’s call this man Micah for simplicity sake. Prior to our
lunch with Micah my group had some difficulty in our
previous lunches with the homeless. Many were appreciative
of the lunches we provided but didn’t feel as comfortable
with us sitting down to share a meal with them. Micah seemed
more open to us sitting down with him but at the same time I
wouldn’t say he was in high spirits when we initially sat
down with him. So my group took a seat on the pavement and
handed out the food as we all began to eat.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
At first it was just our group who did most of the talking.
We told Micah about what we did as students, why we were on
this trip and about some of the activities we did in our
fellowship. After some time Micah started to open up a bit
more to us.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I wasn’t really sure what to expect from his story. I had
some preconceived notions coming in but they didn’t line up
with what I heard from Micah. As a freshman CS student, my
ears perked up when he told us he used to be a web designer
in New Jersey. That was something I didn’t expect to hear.
He had worked there and own his own apartment until he had
got laid off at his job. Times were tough he told us. At the
time he only had so much money to pay for a month or two
more of rent. After that he would be evicted immediately
from his apartment. Usually in times like this people can
fall back on the people close to them, their family and
friends. However, Micah told us he wasn’t close to his
family at that time. When he told his siblings about what
was happening to him they didn’t seem to care. He didn’t
make much a comment about friends when he was recounting
that time. So he didn’t really have a place to go to when he
couldn’t get a job. He told us that moving from New Jersey
to New York City was a wise move when he didn’t have much of
a place to go to. This way he would be able to ask for money
when he can and be able to provide for himself with at least
the bare minimum.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
That’s how we ended up meeting Micah on the corner of that
building that day. As we continued talking with Micah I
wondered if this was really all we could do for him. Was all
we could do just provide a single meal for him? At the time
I couldn’t really find an answer to that question. I was
just a freshman in college who had little to no experience
contemplating these issues. What could I possibly do to help
him in this situation. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Soon we finished up lunch and it was time for us to keep
moving and handing out food throughout the city. As we left
I just suggested Micah to look into freelancing sites since
he had skills that could help him land a job. I gave some
examples of freelancing sites he could check out and he
thanked me for the tips as we left to continue with our
lunches through the city. Then we didn’t see Micah any other
time later that day and yet that question I had back then is
still something I ask myself. What else could we have done
back then.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Micah’s problem was something that was personal to him but
his issue wasn’t something only unique to him. To deal with
a macroscopic issue a larger approach needs to be taken. A
single meal can do a lot for a person but to fix this larger
scale issue is the harder answer to find. Back then as a
freshman in computer science, my understanding of how I
could help with these larger issues was much more limited.
Now that I’ve gotten the chance to learn so much more and
broadened my worldview I’m better equipped to start tackling
these kind of issues. Since then there have been other
issues that have come to mind in addition to issues of
homelessness and poverty. Issues like agriculture scaling,
aiding science researchers, and community development to
name a few.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
However, even with all of these issues only part of me feels 
better equipped. I know I’m more able
to pick up the technologies needed to build these solutions
but I still have so much to learn when it comes to building
solutions for these kinds of issues. How do I know that the
way I design my projects will be able to aid the people I
would like to help? If I don’t make those decisions
carefully, then these solutions may just provide a facade of
help with very little actual impact. That’s what I hope to
learn if being admitted to the fellowship. How to go about
starting these larger projects while keeping the design
focused upon the population of people I’m aiming to help.
How to make the project more than just another software
engineering endeavor but something that has real impact for
another individual. Getting the chance to collaborate with
other students and world changers that share a vision to
work towards developing that kind of change. To also get to
hear from leaders and founders that have walked through this
process before. To hear about the struggles they
encountered along the way and how they were able to combat
them while trying to fix these issues. Then I believe I can
say with more certainty that I will know the proper way to
go about tackling these issues.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
So thank you for reading my open blog post to you Impact
Labs Team. I appreciate that you were able to hear me out 
through my writing. I hope I got to showcase why I wanted to
apply to this fellowship and if accepted, what I hope to
learn from it. Thank you again and look forward to hearing
from you soon!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Building A Classifier For Trending Videos</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quick Disclaimer: This is my first technical blog post
so bear with me as I learn how to write technical blog
posts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Quick Background&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The YouTube algorithm is a mysterious bit of software that many users often ponder over
&lt;em&gt;“Why did this up in my recommended? Why did this pop up
on my feed?”&lt;/em&gt;. In this blog post we won’t be able to
replicate the YouTube algorithm but we may be able to mimic
how YouTube picks it’s trending videos. 
So I created this project with a two friends of mine and it
was our first main venture into data science and machine
learning but something we did happen to learn a lot from. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Getting the Data&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So first we need to have a dataset to work with. There are
two ways we can go about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Find an existing dataset&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Build our dataset&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among my friends and I we actually decided to do both. We
had found an existing online at Kaggle. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new&quot;&gt; Here is
one existing dataset that could be used.&lt;/a&gt; Similar
datasets could be found online at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kaggle.com/datasets&quot;&gt;
Kaggle&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
To get a larger sized dataset we need to scrape YouTube for
trending videos. When I did this with friends we were able
to scrape the Popular on YouTube channel for video id’s of
those trending videos. Now I believe it’s a little harder to
scrape the video page on that channel. However, you should
be able to scrape the videos on the trending tab for the
video id’s. Once you have the list of video id’s you can use
&lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3&quot;&gt;
YouTube’s Data API&lt;/a&gt; to query for data about each individual
video using it’s video id. Here’s a code snippet of how to
query the video data.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;urllib&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;pandas&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pd&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;api_key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'&amp;lt;insert-your-api-key-here&amp;gt;'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;getVideoStats&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;api_key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dataframe&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;read_csv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'location-to-csv-with-video-ids'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;listofIds&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dataframe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'URL'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dropna&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;video_id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;listofIds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# just pick one id for the time being
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;searchUrl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/videos?id='&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;video_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'&amp;amp;key='&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;api_key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'&amp;amp;part=statistics,snippet'&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;urllib&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;urlopen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;searchUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;read&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;decode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'latin-1'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;jsoninfo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;loads&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;jsoninfo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
That snippet describes how to retrieve data about a single
YouTube video. You can run the api call in a loop in order
to get data for all of the youtube videos. One small tip to
speed up the process would be to continually append video
id’s to a single string. Then pass in that string as the
video id and the api would make one request for the amount
of video id’s you passed in (the max being 50 id’s per
request). You’ll want to write the data to a csv file so
that it can be read into a pandas dataframe when you need to
process it. After you’ve gotten all of the video data for
trending videos you need to repeat the process for
nontrending videos. One simple way to do that would be to go
to do different YouTube channels and scrape that channel for
videos. However, you should be careful about what kinds of
videos you’re scraping. For instance many trending videos
will have higher view counts. So if you’re nontrending
dataset consists of videos from really small channels that
have around 1k views each, then that would skew your
dataset. So pick YouTube channels with reasonable metrics
when it comes to their videos.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Creating and training the model&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once your file has its all of its entries of video data. You
can start going about building your model for training. My
friends and I ended up using the tensorflow framework to
build our neural network. The reason being was that it was
quite easy to get a model up and working relatively quickly.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We ended up defining our model as so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;pandas&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pd&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;numpy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;tensorflow&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;tf&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;tensorflow&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;keras&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;model&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;keras&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Sequential&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;keras&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;layers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Dense&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;300&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;kernel_regularizer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;keras&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;regularizers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;l2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.01&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;activation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;tf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;nn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;relu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;keras&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;layers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Dense&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;300&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;kernel_regularizer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;keras&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;regularizers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;l2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.01&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;activation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;tf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;nn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;relu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

        <title>Recreating My Personal Website</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Taking A Look At My Past Sites&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this is about the third time I’ve worked on creating a
personal website. The first time I created my website was in
my freshman year of college as a means of trying to create a
portfolio and trying to test some coding skill. This is
an image of what the site initially looked like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
   &lt;img src=&quot;../../../assets/imgs/website1.PNG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this image the site doesn’t look too bad. However, the
rest of the site was not designed well. It had colored
backgrounds that loosely followed the color scheme set forth
by the initial background image. When designing my first
site I really wanted the first image to be the backdrop for the
site but didn’t know how to setup the design for the rest of
the site. I still don’t really know how to design but I
would like to think I’ve gotten slightly better since
freshman year. Or at the very least have better judgment
when it comes to design choices. Except for the use of
bootstrap I wanted to code this iteration of my site from
the ground up. At the time I was hoping this would be a good
side project to teach me more about web design but to be
honest I didn’t really know much about design practices.
Frankly, I still don’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let’s take a look at what the second iteration of this
site looks like to see the progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
   &lt;img src=&quot;../../../assets/imgs/website2.PNG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This site is a bit different than the first but there are a
few shared aspects. The first commonality between the sites
is the horizontal navbar on the top of both sites. The
second is that both of my sites have a welcome banner for
whoever may be visiting my site. The banner in the v2 of my site makes me cringe
but I also felt it was needed for a personal website at the time.
After going through two iterations for this site and looking
at dozens and dozens of other personal websites on the
Internet I think I’ve started to learn some of the design
aspects I appreciate in personal websites. First, I
appreciate if a website has a minimal theme. In my first
website I believe I stuck to that thought with just a
minimal navbar and background picture as the center piece.
No flashy animations, no extremely vibrant colors, just a
simple image with navigation for the site (with a few other
div’s that hold some content). So I think that was something
I wanted to have in my latest iteration of the site.
However, I still had one issue that was holding me back, I
still didn’t really know much about design. Over time though
I finally decided I switch over to using a static site
generator (jekyll) and use a pre-built theme, instead of
trying to design one myself. That’s how I finally came to
using jekyll along with the 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/niklasbuschmann/contrast&quot;&gt; contrast theme&lt;/a&gt;.
I edited a few things myself, just small things like
changing the color of the footer and adding a reading time
for each of my blog posts. So slowly this site started to
morph into my own, reflecting my taste and personality.
After a while it finally feels like I can settle on a site
that I’m comfortable with.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
At least that’s what I had thought at the time. But even
after switching over from static html/css to a static site
generator, I eventually felt like I wanted a new theme.
After looking over many personal websites online and drawing
inspiration from particularly two (which I’ve given credit
to on my site) I settled on the gravity theme with a bit of
customization. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This theme is definitely closer to what I would like out of
this site but there is still more tinkering I can do with
it. Hopefully I will be able to make some more updates soon.
I’m planning to make one of the first updates to this site
be a dark theme (one that can be toggled).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Blog&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now that I finally have a site I’m happy that I can start
a blog. That was one of my initial motivations to create a
personal website but something I’ve only been able to
achieve with this latest iteration. However, now that I
finally have a blog where I can host my thoughts, comes the
question. What exactly am I going to write about? This
question I don’t fully have answered but I do have a few
ideas. I know among the things I want to write about I want
to reflect on some of my past experiences. Like this past
winter I went to the Urbana Missions conference, so I’m
planning to write a blog post on that just to recap most
things that happened day to day. I would also like to
include a little technical writing on this page. For
instance this past semester I worked in a group for a data
science class to build a classifier to predict trending
YouTube videos. A lot of effort went into that project and I
think writing a blog post breaking down the process would be
a nice way to document my own experiences with machine
learning and my thoughts going into that project. Also I was
hoping to throw in a few creative writing pieces on here
every now and then. Whether those pieces be ones I’ve
written for school or just written in my spare time. But
that’s really all I have planned for this site at the
moment. I’m sure I’ll have more ideas of what to write later
down the line but for the time being I’m a little unsure of
what exactly my future blog posts will be. Maybe that’s just
something comes with writing on a blog. Not knowing what
you’re gonna write about next. Well hopefully it’ll also be
something I’ll get used to.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;edit: I initially wrote this post in back in
January 2019 but am only publishing it now (9/14/2019). At
the time I was still on the second iteration of my site.
More recently I have moved to this third version which has
given me a bit more customization using the Gravity theme&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
